# Bang Driver
  
Does anyone know about, remember, or have an opinion of Bang Golf? Years ago, I bought a--I swear, this is the name--Bangenstein FU2 driver from an online club maker just because I thought the name was hilarious. It did come with a Harrison Striper shaft, so I figured if the driver was a dud, I could always use the shaft. Turns out, the driver (425cc size, I think) was pretty good. I still have it, along with a second, brand new head (don't ask) and headcover. They're both left handed as well. I just wondered if anyone ever played Bang drivers. Apparently they were a big deal in long-drive competitions at one point.

I played ALL Bang woods for almost 12 years. The Bang-o-matic driver as well as the Bang SF 3, 5 and 7 woods. All of those clubs were money and very solid. Probably sold close to 15 sets of the SF Woods to my buddies who hit mine. My son is STILL playing both my 5 and 7 wood now for almost 20 years. Back when Steve Almo had the company they made really good woods. He has long since sold the company and they went to crap. The Bang FU2 was very popular as well.
 
Oh I believe they are still making clubs but for whatever reason they just aren't the same. After playing my original Bang-o-matic for a little over 10 years it developed a small crack at the bottom. Well Steve had already sold the company like 5 years before this happened. Anyway I ordered another one and it just wasn't the same. I contacted the new owner and they said no problem just send it back and we'll replace it. So I did and the replacement wasn't the same either. Just didn't feel or sound near as good as the original, results were not the same either. That was easily the best driver I've ever had!!!
 
Geek under Almo is still kicking, but the guy who was a marketing guru/graphic artist/sounding board recently passed away. Brought out new wedges over the last year or two. Almo is still working it, but his health and eyesight issues keep things limited.
 
The Bang Golf website is still up, but it appears to be frozen in 2016. It actually looks the same as when I discovered it (and bought my Bangenstein FU-2 driver) about 20 years ago. I'm surprised some entrepreneur hasn't come along and bought the company. I wonder how the performance of existing Bang clubs compares to the latest greatest stuff from the mainstream manufacturers. If it's favorable, then product R&D is already a sunk cost, and a new owner could go to market immediately, at a relatively low cost, with a competitive product line. Bang Golf is the most mysterious golf equipment company I've ever seen--an extensive line of clubs highly regarded by many people, and apparently zero effort made to sell them...
 
Well I will say that if the current ( or most current ) Bangomatic or Super Bangomatic was anywhere close to performing like the original I would purchase in a heart beat. As I said before the absolute best driver I have ever owned!!!
 
I know this is about Almo's first company Bang, but I felt like his Geek stuff was even better. The Geek Dot Com This driver is the best feeling driver I've ever hit. Center strikes felt amazing. The Mizuno of drivers.

I have an OMEN HP notebook, and I've been trying to change my audio controller from the Bang & Olufsen one that comes with the notebook to the Realtek HD Audio Manager. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling the Realtek drivers, disabling the Realtek High Definition Audio at the Device Manager but nothing seems to work.
 
No, it's not exactly the audio driver, it's just the audio controller/manager. The driver I presume to be the same, the Realtek one, but I want the Realtek HD Audio Manager instead of the Bang & Olufsen Audio Control (as shown in the pictures I posted).
 
The reason is because Realtek HD Audio Manager is much better than Bang & Olufsen's, has way more options to better equalize your audio. I'm not facing any issues with my audio, I just want to change the audio manager/controller and I just cannot find a way to do it.
 
Disclaimer: HP Doesn't recommend any upgrade/downgrade of any hardware parts or software that is bundled with the product. It may affect the manufacturer's warranty and performance. You can change the configuration at your own risk.
 
You see, the problem is that I cannot find the option to install or uninstall the audio managers. I cannot find a way to uninstall the Bang & Olufsen audio manager, it doesn't show up in 'Programs and Features'. Also, I cannot find a way to install the Realtek HD audio manager alone, it seems to be part of the Realtek HD driver, but when I uninstall and then reinstall the Realtek HD driver it also installs the Bang & Olufsen audio manager automatically, without even asking me if I want it or not.
 
@mdklassen, thanks for trying to help but the link you shared is a solution for doing the exact opposite of what I want to do. As you can see, I've even replied to that post, asking how to do the opposite.
 
Has anyone come across a way to permanently disable or remove this driver? Its causing issues with our zoom sharing, disabling the drivers seems to work temporarily, almost seems to be like embedded in the Realtek driver.
 
You should be able to disable the Bang & Olufsen drivers in Device Manager. Be aware that if you disable them, that will more than likely disable sound for the PC itself so be sure you have an alternative set of speakers available for the laptop. Removing the drivers will only cause them to come back the next time the laptop starts up.
 
Hi, I notice that there are many threads in here with Bang & Olufsen audio issues. I don't want to debate whether the audio is good enough, clearly there are many dissatisfied customers, instead I'm interested in what can be...
 
**The Bang-O-Matic 460cc Titanium Driver** uses flow alignment to direct more energy from club head to ball with less dispersion. Most modern day drivers deliver 78% of the proper directional energy toward the ball with 22% dispersion of energy; with the unique Flow Alignment System the energy transfer is 94% directional energy! This makes for straighter and greater shots! Bang Golf also added slightly more weight to the hosel for draw bias and a deeper bore. The head size is 460cc although it looks more like 400cc. Bang Golf wanted to optimize performance, while have it appeal to players that dislike bulky heads!
 
3 times now I was sitting in my car on break, not driving, and within a minute or two a REALLY loud bang happens in my driver side door. Not sure if its outside or inside. It literally sounds like someone punching my door. It only happens once (that i noticed) each time I start my car. Im not sure if it has anything to do with it being a cold winter or my heat being on high. But it has happened 3 times now and I didnt see anything that would have hit my car. 

 
Since this only seems to happen while on break at work...Are you sure it is not a co-worker playing with you, sneaking up and banging on the door, then hiding? Or if there is snow, throwing a snowball at your door?
 
A very big club head that would boost your confidence upon address to the max. At address it really feel that you would never miss a hit. Upon hitting the sound is loud that would boost your ego.

Altought this club head is big, doesn't mean that hitting it at any part of the face would return you a good distance. I feel that for off centre hits, my distance suffers greatly. However, for centre hits, it seems to travel much longer then any of my drivers I had tried so far. 

Control is something lacking in this driver. The face of this driver feels too "hot" for me to control or even feel the ball. 

This driver is really good for learners. However, do note that prolong using of this club might reduce your ball hitting skill using a driver (thats what happen to me).
 
I bought a big bang 525 and it was heeps good. The first time I took it out it was not very good but when you play with it you get better with it. You need to tee your tees up really high or your balls will go no where. Try swing the club slow for most distance.
 
Price is in UK PoundsI had my original '525' brought back from the 'States by a friend. Specs were 9\* on an Apache/MCC 45" PM-30+ shaft, CPM'd @ 262. It made the loudest clang we'd ever heard from a golf club. Guys at my club would take the rip out of me over the noise AND looks of the club. Calling it "a wok on a stick" and a "dustbin (trash can) on a stick". No big deal I was 'only' using it for a laugh and to rattle folks at my club. However after a couple of weeks a crack started to appear in the soleplate and slowly worked it's way into the face.No big deal, I email Steve Almo at Bang and explained what was happening. He told me if my ss was over 125 I shouldn't be using it. I found him to be an obnoxious A$$! Having sent emails back and forth I called the Bangs importers into the UK (Fusion Golf) and went down to their warehouse to have the head exchanged, there was a fault with the welds on early models and they were aware of it. What a great bunch of guys, they replaced the head AND refit it while I waited. We talked golf, laughed and joked drank soda and watched The Open on their tv. TOTAL QUALITY GUYS! Such a change from the dick at Bang!New head installed I hit the practice tee. What a failure! The loud crack of my old '525' had been replaced by a sound like the old Wilson Carbon Composite Killer Whale. It had lost 20yrds+ and was/is a total dud! Makes a good paper weight or shaving mirror. But not a lot else! Maybe I have the wrong shaft but I've had Proforce 65, Prolite 35+, HTD CB series in it as well as the Apache. It's just not that good a head.
